June 2 - Check scraper with Pry - figure out what is going on... Also, watch this video (1.5 hours): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwBMwZ89Hj8&list=PLc6AmvC5Zybybc-NjUUwQwTtUEXH4iB2s&index=2&t=0s 
It's an intro video for approaching the build.

To give file permissions to execute, run this:
    chmod +x file_name
    EX: to run our CLI, do...
        chmod +x bin/blue_bell
    This will prompt to run bundle install to install the missing gems.
